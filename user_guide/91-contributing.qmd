## Build or serve the docs locally

This project uses `great-docs` (Quarto) for documentation.
Quarto executes Python chunks using the project `.venv` (configured in `docs/_environment`).

From the project root:

```bash
# Build docs into docs/_site/
.venv/bin/great-docs build

# Serve with live reload
.venv/bin/great-docs preview
```
